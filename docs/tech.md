## JavaScript

Our JavaScript is compiled by Babel, using the [`@nuxt/babel-preset-app`](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/blob/dev/packages/babel-preset-app/src/index.js) as a base configuration.

If you're new to features such as `const`, `let`, and `=>` (arrow functions), take some time to read about the following features in Babel's ES2015 guide:

- [Arrow functions](https://babeljs.io/learn-es2015/#ecmascript-2015-features-arrows-and-lexical-this)
- [Template literals](https://babeljs.io/learn-es2015/#ecmascript-2015-features-template-strings)
- [Destructuring](https://babeljs.io/learn-es2015/#ecmascript-2015-features-destructuring)
- [Spread operator](https://babeljs.io/learn-es2015/#ecmascript-2015-features-default-rest-spread)
- [`let`/`const`](https://babeljs.io/learn-es2015/#ecmascript-2015-features-let-const)
- [`for`...`of`](https://babeljs.io/learn-es2015/#ecmascript-2015-features-iterators-for-of)

Reading these sections alone will get you 99% of the way to mastering Babel code. It's also a good idea to read about Promises, if you don't yet feel comfortable with them. Here's a [good intro](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/promises).

### Polyfills

This project uses Nuxt's [modern mode](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/browser-compatibility.html#modern-mode), which creates two bundles: one modern bundle targeting modern browsers that support [ES modules](https://jakearchibald.com/2017/es-modules-in-browsers/), and one legacy bundle targeting older browsers that do not. In order to set up modern mode we need to add the flag -m. In future versions of Nuxt this will be here by default.

For each bundle, polyfills for any JavaScript features you use are included based on the target bundle and supported browsers defined by `browserslist` in `package.json`.

### Vue

Since Vue is such a huge part of our app, I strongly recommend everyone read through at least the _Essentials_ of [Vue's guide](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/).

### Nuxt

To learn more about Nuxt please take a look at [the Nuxt docs](https://nuxtjs.org).

### Vuex (state management)

To wrap your head around state management, I recommend reading through [those docs](https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide), starting at _What is Vuex?_ and stopping before _Application Architecture_. Then skip down and read [_Form Handling_](https://vuex.vuejs.org/en/forms.html) and [_Testing_](https://vuex.vuejs.org/en/testing.html). Finally, read about [state management in this application](state.md).

### JavaScript FAQ

**Why not use TypeScript instead of JavaScript? Isn't that more appropriate for enterprise environments?**

At its current rate of development, I think TypeScript will eventually _become_ the standard, but I don't think it's there yet. First, I don't believe the advantages are currently that significant:

- The vast majority of bugs I encounter are _not_ due to type violations. The most powerful tools against bugs remain linting, tests, and code reviews - none of which are made easier by TypeScript.
- TypeScript doesn't guarantee type safety - that still requires discipline. You can still use hundreds of `any` annotations and libraries without any type definitions.
- In Visual Studio Code, users can already get a lot of useful intellisense (including type information) without having to use TypeScript.
- You can get type checks without static types. Just not at compile time. Between Vue's type checks for props, `typeof`, and `instanceof`, developers can still get warnings about type violations during development and tests.

There are also a few disadvantages I've seen in practice:

- Despite most bugs having nothing to do with type violations, developers can spend _a lot_ of time working towards full type safety. As I mentioned earlier, I think that time would be better spent on tests and code reviews.
- ESLint remains a much more versatile linter than TSLint and [its TypeScript parser](https://github.com/eslint/typescript-eslint-parser) is still experimental, so may waste time with false positives - or worse, simply miss clear violations.

## HTML

All HTML will exist within [`.vue` files](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/single-file-components.html), either:

- in a `<template>`, or
- in a [`render` function](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/render-function.html)

### [Templates](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/syntax.html)

~95% of HTML will be in `.vue` files. Since Vue has a chance to parse it before the browser does, we can also do a few extra things that normally aren't possible in a browser.

For example, any element or component can be self-closing:

```html
<span class="fa fa-comment" />
```

The above simply compiles to:

```html
<span class="fa fa-comment"></span>
```

This feature is especially useful when writing components with long names, but no content:

```html
<FileUploader
  title="Upload any relevant legal documents"
  description="PDFs or scanned images are preferred"
  icon="folder-open"
/>
```

### [Render functions](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/render-function.html)

Render functions are _alternatives_ to templates. Components using render functions will be relatively rare, written only when we need either:

- the full expressive power of JavaScript, or
- better rendering performance through stateless, [functional components](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/render-function.html#Functional-Components)

## CSS

For our styles, we're using SCSS, which you can activate by adding the `lang="scss"` attributes to style tags in Vue components:

```vue
<style lang="scss">
/* Styles go here */
</style>
```

### Tailwind

Almost all of our styling is done using the utilities library tailwind. You can check out their docs for more info on which classes are available. [Tailwind docs](https://tailwindcss.com/)

Tailwind comes with a tailwind.config.js where we can override any of the default options and add new colours, paddings etc.

We should try to have almost all our styles using tailwind unless it isn't possible. This higly reduces our CSS and leaves us with much less code to maintain.

### SCSS

SCSS is a superset of CSS, meaning any valid CSS is _also_ valid SCSS. This allows you to easily copy properties from other sources, without having to reformat it. It also means you can stick to writing the CSS you're still comfortable with while you're learning to use more advanced SCSS features.

I specifically recommend reading about:

- [Variables](http://sass-lang.com/guide#topic-2)
- [Nesting](http://sass-lang.com/guide#topic-3)
- [Operators](http://sass-lang.com/guide#topic-8)

### Importing global CSS

Our main.scss file has been added to our nuxt.config meaning these styles are loaded and available across the whole project

```js
scss: ['@/assets/scss/main.scss'],
```

To globally load all our sass variables, functions and mixins we are using the module styleResources which has been added to our nuxt.config. This means we do not need to manually import our variables etc within each compnent.

```js
styleResources: { scss: ['./assets/scss/variables.scss'], },
```

> NOTE: The `variables` file should never contain code that compiles to actual CSS, as that CSS would be duplicated across every component the file is imported into.

### Referencing aliased asset URLs

Similarly to importing global modules, referencing aliased assets in _non_-module CSS also requires the `~` at the beginning of the name. For example:

```scss
background: url('~@assets/images/background.png');
```

### CSS modules

As mentioned earlier, every Vue component should be a CSS module. That means the classes you define are not _actually_ classes. When you write:

```vue
<style lang="scss" module>
.inputLabel {
  /* ... */
}

.input {
  /* ... */
}
</style>
```

You're actually defining values on a `$style` property of the Vue instance such as:

```js
$style: {
  inputLabel: 'base-input_inputLabel_dsRsJ',
  input: 'base-input_input_dsRsJ'
}
```

These values contain automatically generated classes with:

- the file name of the component
- the name of the class
- a random hash

Do you know what that means?! You can _never_ accidentally write styles that interfere with another component. You also don't have to come up with clever class names, unique across the entire project. You can use class names like `.input`, `.container`, `.checkbox`, or whatever else makes sense within the isolated scope of the component - just like you would with JavaScript variables. -->

#### Styling subcomponents

To pass a class to a child component, it's usually best to do so as a prop:

```vue
<template>
  <BaseInputText :labelClass="$style.label">
</template>

<style lang="scss" module>
.label {
  /* ... */
}
</style>
```

In some cases however, you may want to style a component arbitrarily deep. This should generally be avoided, because overuse can make your CSS very brittle and difficult to maintain, but sometimes it's unavoidable.

In these cases, you can use an [attribute selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors) to take advantage of the fact that generated class names will always _start_ with the same characters:

```vue
<template>
  <div :class="$style.container"><SomeOtherComponentContainingAnInput /></div>
</template>

<style lang="scss" module>
.container [class^='base-input_inputLabel'] {
  /* ... */
}
</style>
```

In the above example, we're applying styles to the `inputLabel` class inside a `base-input` component, but only when inside the element with the `container` class.

#### Sharing SCSS variables with JavaScript

If you ever need to expose the value of an SCSS variable to your JavaScript, you _can_ with CSS module exports! For example, assuming you have this variable defined:

```scss
$size-grid-padding: 1.3rem;
```

You could import our design tooling, then use CSS modules' `:export` it:

```vue
<style lang="scss" module>
@import '@design';

:export {
  grid-padding: $size-grid-padding;
}
</style>
```

Then you can access the value using `this.$style['grid-padding']`.

If you need access from outside a Vue component (e.g. in a Vuex module), you can do so in `src/design/index.scss`. See that file for specific instructions.

### Global CSS

Typically, only [`src/scss/main.scss`](../src/scss/main.scss) should contain global CSS and even that should only include base element styles, animations and utility classes (e.g. for grid management), that are not possible to get with Tailwind. Most classes should however be at component classes and this stylesheet should be very minimal.

### CSS FAQ

**Why use SCSS instead of plain CSS or another CSS preprocessor?**

CSS preprocessors offer a lot of additional power - just having a browser-independent way to use variables is invaluable. But SCSS has some other advantages over competing preprocessors:

- SCSS it a superset of CSS, which means:
  - You can copy and paste valid CSS into SCSS and it will always be valid.
  - There's a gentler learning curve, as devs can write the same CSS they're used to, gradually incorporating more SCSS features as they're needed.
- It's well-supported by both Stylelint and Prettier, eliminating nearly all arguments over code style.

Why use CSS modules for scoping, instead of [Vue's `scoped` attribute](https://vue-loader.vuejs.org/en/features/scoped-css.html)?

While a little more complex to begin with, CSS modules offer:

- Universality. The same scoping strategy can be used anywhere in our app, regardless of whether it's in a `.vue` file or `.scss` file.
- True protection from collisions. Using the `scoped` attribute, vendor CSS could still affect your own classes, if you both use the same names.
- Improved performance. Generated class selectors like `.base-input_inputLabel__3EAebB_0` are faster than attribute selectors, especially on an element selector like `input[data-v-3EAebB]`.
- Increased versatility. There are cases the `scoped` attribute just can't handle, such as passing a scoped class to a child component that does _not_ render HTML directly. This is fairly common for component wrappers of views driven by WebGL or Canvas, that often inject HTML overlays such as tooltips at the root of the `<body>`.
