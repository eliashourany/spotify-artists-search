> This is a [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/guide) + [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/) Project. You can search for Spotify artists, check their albums and open them in Spotify.

## Features

- [**Thorough documentation**](#documentation): Written with the same care as Vue's core docs to quickly train new team members and consolidate knowledge.
- [**Guaranteed consistency**](docs/linting.md): Opinionated linting for Vue, JavaScript/JSON, SCSS, and Markdown, integrated into Visual Studio Code and run against staged files on pre-commit.
- [**First-class tests**](docs/tests.md): Practice test-driven development with both unit and end-to-end tests. Unit tests with Jest live as first-class citizens alongside your source files, while Cypress provides reliable end-to-end tests in an intuitive GUI for development. - coming soon
- [**Speedy development**](docs/development.md): [configurable generators](docs/development.md#generators)so your productivity will skyrocket.
